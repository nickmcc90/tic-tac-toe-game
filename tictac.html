<!--Time to make some javascript and make the play game button 
have an x and o select with a place to put, and also computer moves.-->


<!--Game plan for constructing the code for the game:

We will have a computer function, a human function, and a main display function.
In the beginning, if the computer button is hit:
  We run the computer function, which will call the main display function, and also
  pass a the value that it computed into the main display function.
If the 'Me' button is hit:
  We go straight to the main display function, which will make the tic squares
  active, and we wait for a response click on those squares to proceed to the
  computer function. A click on a square will call the main display function
  with its position value passed in. Basically the main display function is
  only for activating the squares. If we click a square 

Second thought, we can have a computer function, an activate squares function (
that only runs once), and a display function. Upon hitting the computer function,
it runs the activate squares function, then it passes a value into the display
squares function. Upon hitting the me button, we just run the activate squares
function.

**The activate squares function adds event listeners to the squares once the
'me' or 'computer' button is pressed in the beginning.

**We will need fixed position and absolute position elements to cover these squares
in certain situations that we don't want the user touching the squares.

Let's think about the variables to be passed in to the display function and what
the scope of these variables will be next time.

-->

<!--We are in the middle of code.js adding event listeners to the squares... we gotta add fixed elements
to protect these squares now during the computer move... we also gotta find a way to define the player's choice
of x or o and make the computer's move the opposite choice consistently.-->

<!--We did both things. Figure it out.-->

<!--Now we have to add a function that checks to see if we won the game or not! Maybe even keep
track of the score..... localStorage...--> 


<!--Before we added the didWeWin() function, we added a thing where if the human chose a square
that was already filled with a choice, the page would say 'pick something else'

Next time, we will be prepared to add a did we win function.-->
